# Zen Blog

This is a simple blog application. Which is developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/). This is a practice project where i tried implement all neccessary features that a blog should have.
here user can

- read articles
- comment on a article (captcha verified)
- bookmark a article
- view articles by category
- search for articles

I used next js incremental static site generation feature to keep blog up to date with CMS and make blog more seo friendly. to make the blog ui i've used the Tailwindcss.
